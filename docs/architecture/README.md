# Mizon Architecture

This directory contains all architecture-related documentation for the Mizon E-Commerce Platform.

## Documents

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - Document key architectural decisions
- System design diagrams - Visual representations of system architecture
- Component specifications - Detailed component designs

## Architecture Principles

All architecture must align with the [Project Constitution](../../.specify/memory/constitution.md), which establishes:

- Microservices architecture with single responsibility per service
- Test-driven development methodology
- Security-first design
- Enterprise-grade quality standards
- Clean code and comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

When making architectural decisions:

1. Review the constitution principles
2. Document decisions in an ADR
3. Create/update relevant diagrams
4. Ensure alignment with existing architecture
5. Get review from architecture review board
