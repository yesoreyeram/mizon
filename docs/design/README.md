# Design Documentation

This directory contains detailed design documents for the Mizon E-Commerce Platform.

## Purpose

Design documents bridge the gap between architecture and implementation by providing:

- Detailed component specifications
- API contract designs
- Data models and schemas
- Integration patterns
- UI/UX specifications

## Design Principles

All designs must follow:

1. **SOLID Principles** - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
2. **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself
3. **YAGNI** - You Aren't Gonna Need It (keep it simple)
4. **Clean Architecture** - Separation of concerns, dependency inversion

## Design Review Process

Before implementation:

1. Create design document in this directory
2. Include diagrams (sequence, class, component as needed)
3. Define API contracts (OpenAPI spec)
4. Specify data models
5. Document error handling and edge cases
6. Get peer review approval
7. Validate against constitution principles
